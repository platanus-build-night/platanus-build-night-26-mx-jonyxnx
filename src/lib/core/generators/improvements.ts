Representative files:

Produce a short, prioritized doc — do NOT list everything, only what's worth a developer's time:
1. \`# Improvements\` heading.
2. \`## Top improvements\` - a ranked checkbox list of the most impactful items (tech debt, testing gaps, risks, structure). One line each, name the files/areas it touches. Mark guesses as guesses.
3. \`## Nice to have\` - a few smaller, optional items. Skip this section if there's nothing notable.

Be concrete and grounded in the files. Don't invent problems.`;
