Primary language: ${ctx.metadata.language ?? "unknown"}
Top-level directories: ${ctx.topDirs().join(", ") || "(none)"}

Produce a short doc (only what's clearly supported; omit empty sections):
1. \`# Local setup\` heading.
2. \`## Prerequisites\` — runtime/version and package manager, one line each.
3. \`## Install & run\` — the few commands to install and start it locally, from the real scripts/manifests.
4. \`## Environment\` — only the env vars that must be set, briefly. Skip if none.

Keep it tight: a developer should be able to skim it in under a minute.`;
