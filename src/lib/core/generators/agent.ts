Rules:
- Your reader is an autonomous coding agent, not a human doing onboarding. Optimize for fast orientation and safe, correct edits.
- Write ONLY what is supported by the provided files. If something is unknown or absent, say so explicitly. Never invent commands, paths, versions, or behavior.
- Be dense and high-signal, but SHORT: only the essentials an agent needs before touching code (entry points, key files, conventions, hazards, verify commands). Prefer pointers to the other docs over repeating their content.
- Tell the agent which files to open first for each kind of task, what NOT to break, and how to verify a change.
- This file is also the index for the human-facing documentation tree, so explain what other docs exist and when the agent should read them instead of re-deriving context.
- Output GitHub-flavored markdown. No preamble. Start with the requested heading.
- Use flat bullet lists and tables; reference files with backticks and repo-relative paths.`;
